              <p>At Ignite, we believe that young people are the future of the church and have a unique role to play in shaping the world around them. Our goal is to equip them with the tools, resources, and support they need to become leaders and agents of change in their communities.
                    Our youth ministry programs are designed to be fun, engaging, and relevant to the needs and interests of young people today. We offer a variety of activities and events, such as retreats, service projects, social outings, and small group Bible studies, that provide opportunities for young people to connect with each other and with God.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">Our church mission is to love God, love people, and make disciples. 
                his ministry provides a safe and nurturing environment where children can learn about God, the Bible, and their faith in an age-appropriate way.

The primary goal of children's ministry is to introduce children to Jesus Christ and help them develop a personal relationship with Him. This is typically accomplished through a variety of activities, such as Bible lessons, worship, prayer, fellowship, and service projects.</p>
