              <p class="paragraph">Our church mission is to love God, love people, and make disciples. 
                We believe that this mission is at the heart of everything we do as a church. 
                To love God means that we prioritize our relationship with Him above all else, 
                seeking to honor Him with our lives and worship Him with our whole hearts. 
                To love people means that we value every person as a beloved child of God, 
                treating them with dignity, respect, and compassion. We seek to build authentic 
                relationships with one another, encouraging and supporting each other on our 
                journeys of faith. And to make disciples means that we are committed to sharing 
                the good news of Jesus Christ with others, inviting them to join us in our mission 
                and equipping them to live out their faith in their own lives. We believe that 
                this mission is not just for our church community, but for the world around us. 
                Through our words and actions, we seek to make a positive impact on our local 
                community and the world, reflecting God's love and grace to all we encounter.</p>

                  <h1>Vission</h1>
                  <p>At our church, our vision is to create a community where people can encounter 
                      God's love and grace, experience transformation in their lives, and be empowered 
                      to live out their faith in meaningful ways. We believe that this happens 
                      when we gather together in worship, prayer, and fellowship, and when we 
                      serve our local community and the world around us with compassion and generosity. 
                      We envision a church where people of all backgrounds and walks of life are welcomed, 
                      valued, and included, and where everyone is encouraged to use their unique gifts 
                      and talents for the glory of God. We aim to be a church that is deeply rooted 
                      in God's Word and led by the Holy Spirit, always seeking to grow in our knowledge 
                      and love of Jesus Christ. Our vision is to be a light in the darkness, 
                      a beacon of hope, and a catalyst for transformation in our world..</p>
